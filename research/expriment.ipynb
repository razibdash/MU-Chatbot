The launching of the Website of the University is definitely a forward leap; we now open up our doors to global students. We are working here with devotion and with a vision for a bright tomorrow.

Indeed, the country has seen a tremendous increase in enrolment over the last decade or so. Total tertiary enrolment has more than tripled since 2000. The strength of public universities was direly insufficient to keep up with this phenomenal increase in the demand for higher education. Against this backdrop, there was a change in the age-old notion that the state alone is to shoulder the burden of tertiary education and accommodating the private universities to share this national duty, of course, without making any compromise in academic excellence and other matrices of higher university education. Metropolitan University joins this historic shift to bring quality higher education at affordable cost to the doorsteps of the students.\\n\\nWith the approval of the Ministry of Education under the Private University Act of 1992 (which was amended first in 1998 and then again in 2010), Metropolitan University came into being on 3rd May 2003.\\n\\nDr. Toufique Rahman Chowdhury, an educationist and a promising entrepreneur of the country initiated the idea of founding Metropolitan University with the direct participation and assistance of a few of his close friends, acquaintances, and associates.\\n\\n“2018” Celebrating Fifteen Years of Success in Quality Education\\n\\n“2017” Inauguration of Permanent Campus\\n\\n“2016” Celebrated thirteen years of Excellence in Education\\n\\n“2015” Second Convocation of the University\\n\\n“2014” Membership of the Accreditation Service for International Schools, Colleges & Universities\\n\\n“2013” Celebrated Ten years of Serving the country through ensuring quality higher education\\n\\n“2012” Opening of Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering\\n\\n“2011” Land procurement for permanent campus of the University, within Sylhet city\\n\\n“2010” The First Convocation of the University held\\n\\n“2009” Membership of the Association of Commonwealth Universities\\n\\n“2008” Collaboration with Birmingham City University, UK\\n\\n“2007” Over 1000 regular students in four schools and five departments\\n\\n“2006” High-Powered Government Team: One of the most prospective Universities in Bangladesh & ranked among top 15 in Bangladesh\\n\\n“2005” Opening of Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences and Law\\n\\n“2004” Opening of most modern and facilitated campus with high-speed campus backbone network\\n\\n“2003” Establishment of the University, approved by the UGC & Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nUniversity Overview\\n\\nLeadership and Management\\n\\nConvocation\\n\\nNews & Events\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAdmission\\n\\nUndergraduate\\n\\nGraduate\\n\\nProgramme Fee Structure\\n\\nScholarship & Aid\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nDepartments\\n\\nComputer Science & Engineering\\n\\nSoftware Engineering\\n\\nElectrical & Electronic Engineering\\n\\nBusiness Administration\\n\\nEconomics\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\nLaw & Justice\\n\\nCampus Life\\n\\nDigital Campus\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\nLaboratory Resources\\n\\nCafeteria\\n\\nClub & Organisations\\n\\n© Metropolitan University 2025 Legal Privacy Policy Cookie Statement FOLLOW US Facebook YouTube\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

Student life is ripe time to select the arena of study to fulfill that dream. In world most students select law as a branch of study to reach in their destination. Considering some objectives and way of education, it is also called professional subject. Like a few other branches of education law enables a student to excel himself up serving the best to the society, as well as the country. The magnitude of the subject can easily be traced staring at the universities admission struggle against a single seat by more than hundred students. Degree in law crates the scope to the holders to step into the doors of the following professions:\\n\\nAdvocate\\n\\nFirst wish and opportunity of law student is to be an advocate. An advocate can conduct any suit or case before any lower court situated in Bangladesh. To be an advocate, it is firstly needed to have a ‘Sanad’ from Bangladesh Bar Council. For this, some procedure must be maintained. After obtaining law degree, a student needs to join with a senior advocate entering into a contract of pupilageship who has practiced at least 10 year before lower court. After expiring 6 months of contract as per as the schedule of Bangladesh Bar Council, he/she will be eligible to sit for the examination of ‘Sanad’. Firstly, student has to give a preliminary test of 100 marks. After passing successfully in the preliminary examination the candidate will appear for written examination. And lastly successful candidate will be selected through a viva-voce. Selected candidate will be enrolled as an advocate to their chosen Bar Association as well Bangladesh Bar Council.\\n\\nBarrister\\n\\nIn every country Barristers are respected by all. To be a barrister it is needed to have a Bar Vocational Course of eight to nine months from one of the four Inns of Court such as Lincoln’s Inn, Inner Temple, Middle Temple, and Gray’s in of England. But the prerequisite to do the same is a law degree from any university or college of England. In our country many institutions affiliated with the university and college of England offer law degree. So, the first step can be done in our country but to get BVC course you have to go to England. Who have completed LL.B. (Hon’s.) degree from any reputed university in Bangladesh will get exemption of some subjects from the total subjects. But barrister is not an advocate. Barrister is not a mandatory requirement to practice before any courts or tribunals. To be an advocate the condition is as like as other with some exceptions described in the enrollment procedures of Bar Council. To stand before any court to conduct the suit or case ‘Sanad’ is a must.\\n\\nLegal Advisor/Law officer\\n\\nIn every organization to deal their legal matters legal advisor or law officer are appointed. So, the students of law have only the opportunity to be a legal advisor or a law officer in this regard. Generally, minimum requirements to be the same is a law degree with second class or LL.B. (Hon’s.) with LL.M. In most cases advocates are preferred for the post. In many Government organizations, Nongovernment organization, Defense service (Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy, Bangladesh Air Force), Bank, University, Real Estate Company, and so on law graduates can be engaged as a legal advisor. Advertisement is frequently published in daily newspapers to recruit legal advisor for many reputed organizations.\\n\\nJudge\\n\\nThe law graduates who have brilliant aademic background and want to play vital role in establishing justice in society may intent to be judge in lower court or judge of Supreme Court. After the separation of judiciary from executive, Judicial Service Commission is responsible to regulate the procedures for appointing judges of lower court. Requirements for applying for the post of Assistant Judge are LL.B. degree with second class or LL.M with second class. The recruitment procedure is continued through Preliminary Test of 100 marks, Written Test of 1000 marks and viva-voce of 100 marks. Pass marks of preliminary, written test and viva-voce are 55%, 50%, and 50% respectively. To qualify in the examination, it is needed to have a vast knowledge of both substantive and procedural laws alongwith Bangladesh affairs, International affairs, Bangla, English, Math and General Science. To be judge in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh it is needed to practice as an advocate in Supreme Court at least 10 years or judicial officer who has performed for 10 years will be eligible for the same.\\n\\nLawyer in some Special Subjects\\n\\nLaw graduates can work with some fields of law which bear a great importance in the present global context. It is needed to have a better knowledge and also much interest on those subjects. In this way a lawyer may also be termed depending upon one’s choice and specialization as Environmental Lawyer, Immigration Lawyer, Income Tax Lawyer, Human Rights Lawyer, Labour Advisor etc.\\n\\nAcademicians\\n\\nIt is another opportunity for those law graduates who have strong academic background and a great fascination for becoming an academician in universities or other institutions where law is taught. Actually, it shall not be proper to treat teaching as a profession as here you have the opportunity to enlighten someone with your knowledge who will try to do the best to the society.\\n\\nResearcher\\n\\nSometimes interest on research may be created by anyone but he/she will have to know the research methodology and have a habit of studying a lot of books, Journals, Newspaper, or other academic materials of different spheres of law or other branches. Organizations appoint researcher to do the same in a specific issue selected by them.\\n\\nGovernment Service\\n\\nGovernment service especially Cadre service attracts many times to the law graduates. First Class gazetted Officers in different branches or department of government are appointed by Public service Commission through BCS (Bangladesh Civil Service) and other examination conducted by Public Service Commission or other government organization. Students of law can compete for general post in no-cadre services. Besides, student can compete for other government services. To be successful in this arena, law graduates need a vast knowledge on Bangladesh Affairs, International Affairs, Bangla, English, Math, and General Science.\\n\\nNon-Government Organizations\\n\\nLaw graduates can also join in Non-governmental Organization holding various posts which are not related with law. He may be banker, administrative officer etc.\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nUniversity Overview\\n\\nLeadership and Management\\n\\nConvocation\\n\\nNews & Events\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAdmission\\n\\nUndergraduate\\n\\nGraduate\\n\\nProgramme Fee Structure\\n\\nScholarship & Aid\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nDepartments\\n\\nComputer Science & Engineering\\n\\nSoftware Engineering\\n\\nElectrical & Electronic Engineering\\n\\nBusiness Administration\\n\\nEconomics\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\nLaw & Justice\\n\\nCampus Life\\n\\nDigital Campus\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\nLaboratory Resources\\n\\nCafeteria\\n\\nClub & Organisations\\n\\n© Metropolitan University 2025 Legal Privacy Policy Cookie Statement FOLLOW US Facebook YouTube\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

It started its journey in January, 2012. This department runs the B.Sc Engg program for diploma holders besides the regular B.Sc Engg program. This department has a very strong faculty of nine fulltime members among which one fulltime Professor, one Associate Professor, three Assistant Professors and five Senior Lecturers.\\n\\nThe main focus of the EEE Dept. is on four major areas – power, electronics, communication and computer in the undergraduate curricula. The expertise of the faculty members of this department covers various fields ranges from power systems to nanotechnology. The research areas of teachers and students of this department include power, energy, electrical machines, solid state device, signals and systems, signal processing, image processing, device modeling, power electronics, control engineering, high voltage engineering, biomedical engineering, microwave engineering, wireless communication, fabrication, renewable energy, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, VLSI and nanotechnology.\\n\\nFaculty members of this department collaborate with the Government (A2I Innovation Hub) , power generation, telecommunication and electronic companies, other universities, and centers of excellence through the basic and applied research programs and contracts. Undergraduate students of this department contribute directly to advancements in applied science and technology through their final year projects.

Since 2014, just after showcasing a new and better EVM to the National Election Commission, the Department of EEE, MU has been drawing the attention of the top notch students of Bangladesh as their first choice of study. The future for graduates from this department looks very promising both at home and abroad because there is shortage of quality graduates in the market in the booming field of power, electronics, communication and computer. Specially, in the fields of power Bangladesh is experiencing steady growth due to the current need. Electronics market has also started to grow slowly in our country. All these things will work in the favor of EEE graduates in the future and graduates of this department will definitely be competitive enough to secure their place in the job market due to the better quality education provided by this department.\\n\\nThe new generation of Electrical and Electronic Engineers are encouraged to undertake research and development activities in all the areas of this rapidly expanding and fascinating discipline of engineering. The department is committed to the study and analysis of fundamental as well as applied problems. Teachers and students of the department work in solving real life problems and provide suitable low-cost solution for those problems. The Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Metropolitan University is striving to realize its vision and mission to place itself on the top with national and international recognition of its teaching, and research programs. So far with limited resources and facility the Department has succeeded to do so as a result of sincere effort of its faculty and students. Contribution, cooperation and collaboration of all from outside the university are also a major factor in attaining such goal. We hope the support of national and international organizations and the Authority of Metropolitan University will continue and increase in the days ahead so that we can achieve our objective and goal.\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nUniversity Overview\\n\\nLeadership and Management\\n\\nConvocation\\n\\nNews & Events\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAdmission\\n\\nUndergraduate\\n\\nGraduate\\n\\nProgramme Fee Structure\\n\\nScholarship & Aid\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nDepartments\\n\\nComputer Science & Engineering\\n\\nSoftware Engineering\\n\\nElectrical & Electronic Engineering\\n\\nBusiness Administration\\n\\nEconomics\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\nLaw & Justice\\n\\nCampus Life\\n\\nDigital Campus\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\nLaboratory Resources\\n\\nCafeteria\\n\\nClub & Organisations\\n\\n© Metropolitan University 2025 Legal Privacy Policy Cookie Statement FOLLOW US Facebook YouTube\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

The goal of the research center is to encourage, conduct and publicise research. The center conducts seminars, workshops, tours and publishes various research/resource materials on current issues.\\n\\nCentre for Training, Research & Publication\\n\\nTeaching and research should go side by side. Teaching with research can become more useful, effective and interesting than without it. Conducting studies and research presumably supports and enriches teaching materials. Depending on books written by foreign authors based on alien and unfamiliar environments and situations with examples drawn from those conditions without support of relevant materials of local and national origin tends to ruake both teaching and learning distracting and very difficult.\\n\\nThe result of the above reasons is the establishment of the Centre for Research & Publication (CRP). The main objectives of establishment are:\\n\\n1. To conduct studies and research on various aspects / issues of business administration with a view to generating information primarily for use in teaching.\\n\\n2. To provide a forum to the teachers of the University to carry out studies and research in their respective fields of specialisation and interest, thereby enabling them to enrich their teaching materials with examples from real life of local situations. The areas of research / studies will include management, marketing, finance, communication, accounting, personnel management, management information systems, business ethics etc.\\n\\nCRP has organised so far talks and seminars on the following topics:\\n\\n1. Research Methodology\\n\\n2. Industrial Management with reference to Chhatak Cement Co. Ltd.\\n\\n3. Banking system in Bangladesh\\n\\n4. Herbal Medicine: Efficacy and Potentials\\n\\n5. Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Govt. of Bangladesh\\n\\n6. Research Techniques as applied to Business Management\\n\\n7. Challenge in Management: A case of Lafarze Plant\\n\\n8.
